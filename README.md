# Responsive Navbar

View demo [here](https://ypds.github.io/navbar/).

## Test on Local Machine

Include the ```navbarDemo``` function to your desired controller on your localhost, and ```navbarDemo.cfm``` to the corresponding view folder. The navbar depends on jquery. For testing the following tags can be added to the ```<head>```. Note, if the viewport meta is not included then responsive features may not work.

```html
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```
